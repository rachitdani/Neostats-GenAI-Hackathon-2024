7. **Foreign Exchange Risk**: Currency fluctuations affect Amazon’s international revenue and costs, impacting financial results.

8. **Operational Challenges**: Rapid expansion imposes pressure on Amazon's operational, financial, and managerial resources, potentially affecting performance and growth.

9. **Inventory Management Risks**: Misjudgments in inventory levels can lead to financial loss due to markdowns or missed sales opportunities.

10. **Compliance with Regulations**: Navigating a complex regulatory landscape, including evolving internet laws, tax regulations, and data protection laws, poses challenges and potential costs.

11. **Legal Proceedings**: Amazon is involved in numerous legal disputes that could result in substantial financial liabilities and operational disruptions.

12. **Tax Liabilities and Obligations**: Changes in tax laws or disputes with tax authorities could lead to increased tax liabilities and compliance costs.
